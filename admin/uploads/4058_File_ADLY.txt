Community development is a process which community members are supported by agencies to identify and take collective creations on issues which are important to them .It empowers community 	
   Futhermore , community development is also a belief that all people should have total access to a comfortable living forms of living such as Healthcare, Education,Justice,Security and other opportunities’ With all the forms of development mentioned above there are barriers or limitations that hinders the development if a community.OR  It is the delay or abnormal patterns of development in the areas of communication,social and adaptive. Some example are as follows; 
 .Health Issues 
 .Inequality In Wealth Distribution
 .Poverty 
 I will elaborate more on poverty in the KONOGOLOU commnunity the Northern Sector  Of GHANA. The impact of growth in Ghana especially in my  community has slowed substanability over the years .Ghana’s largest fall in poverty ,0.2% per year. The growth elasticity of poverty .(percentage reduction in economic growth) has decreased , from -1.18 between 1992 and 1998 to -0.07 between 2012and 2016. This may reflect the declining contribution of agriculture, in which the majority of poor  households are engaged ,the limited job opportunities for higher productivity in the services sector and a largely capital-intensive industrial development.
   In addition, Ghana has seen a persistent and increasing spatial inequality .Poverty rates have stagnated in my community and absolute number of poor has increased . Poverty  rates remain above 50% in my region especially my community .Poverty rates also now vary widely across towns in my districts within my region.In the North-EastRegion, the districts in the eastern parts achieves significant poverty reduction while the western districts which my community happens to fall within gets an increase in poverty.
The spatial inequities reflect both ecological conditions and disparties in services delivery.Agricultural remains the dominant employer in the North-East Region, espercially my community,but the climate is not suitable for cocoa and some other cash crops.Farmers in my district or community are mainly engaged in rain-fed, traditional subsistence agriculture: they use few modern inputs, receive inadequate extension services,and have limited access to electricity,market ,and have limited access to irrigation.There is also a substantial difference between poor and rich districts in access to electricity, market and roads.And unsubstantial farming pratices have led to lower soil quality , higher erosion,and lower agricultural outputs in my KONOGOLOU which is my community. 
KONOGOLOU is a suburban in the the North-East Region of Ghana .KONOGOLOU is the capital of the 

North-East region of Ghana .It is made up of both rural and urban settlements ,the town or community has a very deplorable market structure, 12 school buildings of which 5 are secondary schools ,3 out of the 12 are also vocational and technical schoolsand the remaining ones are basic schools which has a very poor structure which is not suitable and conduci ve  the teaching and learning  activities in my community.This has made my community  one of  the poorest community or town in the region. The community has many potential potentiates who are aspiring to be good leaders,enterprenuers ,lawyers and the others but due to  the poor state of my community it hindering or limiting them  from achieving thieir dreams and aspirations.. And also the due the developmental issue spoken or elaborated above has led many community members down the drain in a sense that they have involved theirselves in socialvices such as theft,prostitution and black marketing.
Education
Standard of living
Proper HealthCare
 
 To begin with ;the issue addressed on above as major effects on the SDGs mentioned above but  only three are going to be elaborated on .  Education ;Poverty has made members in my community who piroties education  cannot get total or no access to it because it is expensive for them to afford .  This is because to get a very nice and comfortable experience of Education,the individual must be enrolled in an institution,get uniforms,learning materials inorder  to  make teaching and learning effective.Thus when member of my community do not enjoy Education like the other people in the neighbouring community. 
 Secondly,Healthcare services have also been affected  by limiting access to proper nutrition foods;shelter;safe neighborhood to live ;clean air; water and many others. Poverty affects the mental illness ans substance use disorder are all prevalent in my community due to the low income earned by them.
  Futhermore, the standard of living in my community is very bad due to the current development issue at stake.the standard of living in konogolo is very bad because we don’t not hv adequate jobs or we lack salary earning jobs,food,portable drinking water,shelters and ,many other. And aslo the opperession by the communuity leaders and some govern mental officials contributes to the poor state of the community.
   RECOMMENDATION AND CONCLUSION
Whether you have preconceived notions about poverty within the community ,or as a concept in general,it’s important to challenge  the assumptions so you do not fall victim unintentionally spreading harmful biases. A common myth is homeless or helpless people did not make or live a useful life when they were younger or had the chance to work.This misconception is very incredibly harmful,because it neglects the other uncontolable conditions that can cause poverty.
 If an individual recognize this cocept mentioned above one must make sure to work towards challenging it. And also one can create an awareness on what poverty is and it causes to the community members,charity works can also be done in order to control or curb poverty .and last but not the least public educaton and skills can be organised for the people inorder to control poverty.
